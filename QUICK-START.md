## 🚀 Your Immediate Next Steps

Follow these steps to get your assessment started today:

---

## Step 1: Add Files to Your Repository (15 minutes)

### 1.1 Copy the artifacts I created for you:

I've created these 4 files for you in the artifacts above:
1. **README.md** - Enhanced repository overview
2. **ASSESSMENT.md** - Complete assessment questions
3. **PROGRESS.md** - Weekly progress tracker
4. **QUICK-START.md** - This file

### 1.2 Add them to your repo:

```bash
# Navigate to your repo
cd path/to/DSA-Assessment-2025-2026

# Create/update README.md
# (Copy content from the README artifact I created)

# Create ASSESSMENT.md
# (Copy content from the ASSESSMENT artifact)

# Create PROGRESS.md
# (Copy content from the PROGRESS artifact)

# Create QUICK-START.md
# (Copy content from this artifact)

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add assessment structure and documentation"
git push origin main
```

---

## Step 2: Create Folder Structure (5 minutes)

Create the following folders in your repository:

```bash
mkdir -p Part1-Conceptual
mkdir -p Part2-Code-Reading
mkdir -p Part3-Basic-Problems
mkdir -p Part4-Intermediate
mkdir -p Part5-Advanced
mkdir -p Part6-System-Design
mkdir -p Part7-OOP

# Verify structure
ls -la
```

Your repo should now look like:
```
DSA-Assessment-2025-2026/
├── README.md
├── ASSESSMENT.md
├── PROGRESS.md
├── QUICK-START.md
├── LICENSE
├── Part1-Conceptual/
├── Part2-Code-Reading/
├── Part3-Basic-Problems/
├── Part4-Intermediate/
├── Part5-Advanced/
├── Part6-System-Design/
└── Part7-OOP/
```

## Tips for Success

### While Solving Assessment:

1. **Be Honest:** Don't look up solutions - write what you know
2. **Explain Your Thinking:** Even wrong answers help me understand your thought process
3. **Time Box:** Don't spend more than suggested time on each part
4. **Write Comments:** In code, write what you're trying to do
5. **If Stuck:** Write "Stuck here because..." - that's valuable info!

### Code Format Example:

```cpp
// Problem: Array Product Except Self
// Date: Nov 20, 2025
// Language: C++

/*
APPROACH:
1. [Explain your approach]
2. [Step by step logic]
3. [Why you chose this approach]

TIME COMPLEXITY: O(?)
SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(?)
*/

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
    // Your code here
}

int main() {
    // Test case
    vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    vector<int> result = productExceptSelf(arr);
    
    // Print result
    for(int num : result) {
        cout << num << " ";
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
